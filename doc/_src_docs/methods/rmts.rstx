Regularized minimal-energy tensor-product splines
=================================================

Regularized minimal-energy tensor-product splines (RMTS) is a type of surrogate model for
low-dimensional problems with large datasets and where fast prediction is desired.
The underlying mathematical functions are tensor-product splines,
which limits RMTS to up to 4-D problems, or 5-D problems in certain cases.
On the other hand, tensor-product splines enable a very fast prediction time
that does not increase with the number of training points.
Unlike other methods like Kriging and radial basis functions,
RMTS is not susceptible to numerical issues when there is a large number of training points
or when there are points that are too close together.

The prediction equation for RMTS is

.. math ::

  \newcommand\RR{\mathbb{R}}
  \newcommand\w{\mathbf{w}}
  \newcommand\H{\mathbf{H}}
  \newcommand\F{\mathbf{F}}
  \newcommand\y{\mathbf{y}}
  \newcommand\x{\mathbf{x}}
  \newcommand\yt{\mathbf{yt}}
  \newcommand\xt{\mathbf{xt}}
  \newcommand\sumt{\sum_i^{nt}}
  y = \F(\x) \w ,

where
:math:`\x \in \RR^{nx}` is the prediction input vector,
:math:`y \in \RR` is the prediction output,
:math:`\w \in \RR^{nw}` is the vector of spline coefficients,
and
:math:`\F(\x) \in \RR^{nw}` is the vector mapping the spline coefficients to the prediction output.

RMTS computes the coefficients of the splines, :math:`\w`, by solving an energy minimization problem
subject to the conditions that the splines pass through the training points.
This is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem
where the objective function consists of a term containing the second derivatives of the splines,
another term representing the approximation error for the training points,
and another term for regularization:

.. math ::

  \begin{array}{r l}
    \underset{\w}{\min} & \frac{1}{2} \w^T \H \w
    + \frac{1}{2} \beta \w^T \w
    \\
    &
    + \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\alpha}
    \sumt \left[ \F(\xt_i) \w - \yt_i \right] ^ 2
  \end{array} ,

where
:math:`\xt_i \in \RR^{nx}` is the input vector for the :math:`i` th training point,
:math:`yt_i \in \RR` is the output value for the :math:`i` th training point,
:math:`\H \in \RR^{nw \times nw}` is the matrix containing the second derivatives,
:math:`\F(\xt_i) \in \RR^{nw}` is the vector mapping the spline coefficients to the :math:`i` th training output.
and :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\beta` are regularization coefficients.

In problems with a large number of training points relative to the number of spline coefficients,
the energy minimization term is not necessary;
this term can be zero-ed by setting the reg_cons option to zero.
In problems with a small dataset, the energy minimization is necessary.
When the true function has high curvature, the energy minimization can be counterproductive
in the regions of high curvature.
This can be addressed by increasing the quadratic approximation term to one of higher order,
and using Newton's method to solve the nonlinear system that results.
The nonlinear formulation is given by

.. math::

  \begin{array}{r l}
    \underset{\w}{\min} & \frac{1}{2} \w^T \H \w
    + \frac{1}{2} \beta \w^T \w
    \\
    &
    + \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\alpha}
    \sumt \left[ \F(\xt_i) \w - \yt_i \right] ^ p
  \end{array}
  ,

where :math:`p` is the order given by the approx_order option.
The number of Newton iterations can be specified via the :code:`nln_max_iter` option.

RMTS is implemented in SMT with two choices of splines:

1. B-splines (RMTB): RMTB uses B-splines with a uniform knot vector in each dimension.
The number of B-spline control points and the B-spline order in each dimension are options
that trade off efficiency and precision of the interpolant.

2. Cubic Hermite splines (RMTC): RMTC divides the domain into tensor-product cubic elements.
For adjacent elements, the values and derivatives are continuous.
The number of elements in each dimension is an option that trades off efficiency and precision.

In general, RMTB is the better choice when training time is the most important,
while RMTC is the better choice when accuracy of the interpolant is the most important.
