      "The surrogate model toolbox (SMT) is a Python package that includes several surrogate models---least squares (LS), square polynomial (PA2), inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, PLS-based models (KPLS, KPLS and GEKPLS), radial basis functions (RBF) and regularized minimal-energy tensor-product splines (RMTS).\n",

      "In addition to the different sampling methods available in SMT, many well-known analytical and engineering test functions are implemented as well. Other alternative methods could be easily implemented and added into SMT. \n",
      "Therefore, this package is devoted to gathering several types of surrogate models within the same platform, for providing a benchmark to the engineering field. Another purpose of the SMT is for research purposes and contributing to the literature on the surrogate modeling.\n",
