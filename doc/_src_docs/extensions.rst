Extensions
==========

Extensions implement a set of methods using surrogate models provided by SMT.
Two methods are available:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :titlesonly:

   extensions/moe
   extensions/vfm
   extensions/mfk


The intent is to provide applications of surrogate models in higher level methods.
